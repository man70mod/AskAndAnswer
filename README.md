For multi-language app:
1. First video of YT: User chooses the language=> dart file+i18n+ .tr. There is an issue -> translation by developer
2. Second video of YT by hasan norozi: App automatically chooses the language=> localization package- .delegate for right and left writing, supported locales for languages according to usere's phone language, creating new json file for content translation. There is an issue -> translation by developer
